{{- if .Values.loki.enabled }}
Grafana Loki has been deployed as a single binary.
This means a single pod is handling reads and writes. You can scale that pod vertically by adding more CPU and memory resources.
See https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/loki/ for more details.

The in-cluster query URL for the data source in Grafana is:
http://{{ .Release.Name }}-loki-gateway.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local/
{{- end }}

{{- if index .Values "fluent-bit" "enabled" }}
Fluent Bit has been deployed to collect logs from your pods.

You can check the status of Fluent Bit using:
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=fluent-bit -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

By default, Fluent Bit is configured to:
- Collect container logs from all namespaces
- Parse logs in JSON format when possible
- Forward logs to Loki

For more information on configuring Fluent Bit, see:
